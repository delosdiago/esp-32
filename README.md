# Esp-32
ESP-32 PCB design 
Objective: To design my custom ESP-32 board from its schematic 
Learning Outcomes: Through this project I learnt a lot of things. 
               1. how to use EDA tools such as EasyEDA and EDAPlayground.
               2. how to read datasheets and gather relevant information from them.
               3. how to efficiently plan the PCB layout, fixing errors that come along the way and improving power conditions.
